# Pharma Supply Chain System using Smart Contracts

## Overview

The pharmaceutical industry faces significant challenges related to the security and integrity of the supply chain, including counterfeiting, diversion, and theft. These challenges compromise patient safety, reduce the effectiveness of drugs, and cause financial losses for companies. Traditional paper-based supply chain management systems are outdated, inefficient, and prone to errors and delays.

This Pharma Supply Chain System leverages **Smart Contracts** and **Blockchain** technology to create a secure, transparent, and immutable record of every transaction within the supply chain. It ensures that every step from manufacturing to dispensing is monitored and recorded, preventing fraud and improving efficiency.

## Key Features

1. **Smart Contract Management**:
   - Automates compliance with predefined conditions during various stages of the supply chain, ensuring that operations like manufacturing, packaging, and shipping only proceed when specific conditions are met.
   
2. **Blockchain for Transparency**:
   - All transactions within the supply chain are recorded on an immutable blockchain, providing a tamper-proof history of each drug's journey from manufacturer to consumer.

3. **AES Data Encryption**:
   - Sensitive data, such as batch numbers, are encrypted using AES encryption before being stored on the blockchain, ensuring data privacy and security.

4. **Enhanced Audit Function**:
   - The system provides a detailed audit of the supply chain, displaying all transactions in a clean, tabular format that is easy to read and understand.

## How It Works

### Main Functions

- **Manufacture Drug**: Record the manufacturing of a drug, ensuring that the process meets smart contract conditions.
- **Package Drug**: Log the packaging of a drug, securely associating it with a batch number and timestamp.
- **Ship Drug**: Record the shipment of drugs, tracking the receiver's ID and shipment details.
- **Receive Drug**: Log the receipt of drugs by a receiver, ensuring that the shipment ID matches the smart contract conditions.
- **Dispense Drug**: Finalize the process by recording the dispensing of drugs to the end-user.
- **Audit Supply Chain**: View a detailed, tabular audit of all transactions within the supply chain.

### Example Usage of Smart Contracts and Data Encryption

1. **Smart Contracts**: 
   - Before any operation like shipping or receiving, the system checks predefined conditions (e.g., verifying that a receiver ID is present) to ensure compliance with supply chain policies.

2. **Data Encryption**:
   - Batch numbers and other sensitive data are encrypted using AES encryption before being stored on the blockchain, and are decrypted only when needed for display.

## Technologies Used

1. **Python**: Core language used to develop the system.
2. **Blockchain (Simulated)**: For creating an immutable ledger of supply chain transactions.
3. **AES Encryption**: For securing sensitive data within the system.

## Future Enhancements

- **Integration with IoT Devices**: Real-time monitoring of drug storage conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity) throughout the supply chain.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Predictive analytics to identify potential supply chain disruptions before they occur.
- **Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)**: Integration with other blockchain platforms to create a decentralized supply chain network.
- **Smart Contract Automation**: Further enhancement of smart contract conditions to include automated dispute resolution.
